## Project Organization

### `src`

The source folder (`src`) contains the original source code that developers write as part of the app.

### `dist`

The distribution build folder (`dist`) contains the built files for a production build.

1. Bundle JavaScript (necessary for webpack, even if not needed yet in project)
2. `index.html` - the html page
